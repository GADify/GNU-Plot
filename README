These are SWIX files for use in Arista EOS. In a nutshell, I've collected
all of the dependency RPMs and put them together into a single installable
extension. 

To learn how to do this yourself, check out this excellent EOS Central 
article: https://eos.arista.com/package-rpms-into-an-arista-swix-extension/

This was done primarily for use with CPU-Hist, though other tools may be 
forthcoming. I code when I can't sleep. :)
